CREATE TABLE Employee (
    id INT  PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100) ,
    department_id INT,

insert into Employee values(3,"Nik","prod","nik@123",3,"2023-08-07");


CREATE INDEX emp_index ON Employee (id);

-- Query using the indexed column
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE id = 1;

-- Query without using the index
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE first_name = 'Nik';

-- Sorting by the indexed column
SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY id;

-- Sorting by a non-indexed column
SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY first_name;


ALTER TABLE Employee ADD CONSTRAINT UNIQUE (id);

DROP INDEX emp_index ON Employee;
